# CS 403 - Topics in Programming Languages - Week 2

Welcome to Week 2! We're going to start covering advanced programming topics this week. This week we will look at code debugging. We will focus on C# and Visual Studio and some of its unique abilities, but we will also discuss similar techniques in other languages. 

Visual Studio makes debugging a lot more "fun" and intuitive than some other languages and runtimes. (If you have ever needed to debug C code while it is running using `gdb`, you'll understand why Visual Studio's debugger is popular.) C# and its framework also provide some convenience methods for debugging, such as `Debug.WriteLine` which specifically prints output into the Debug Output window in Visual Studio. As a comparison, other languages often provide a logging module of some sort, and if you've ever used a command line tool that allows you to specify `--verbose` -- sometimes more than once -- that is the same concept at work.

Some of this week's concepts will touch on items we will cover next week - polymorphism, classes and inheritance. The debug system is important to become familiar with early on, as you will likely find yourself using it regularly as you write and debug your code. While we will have some surface-level discussion of classes and such this week, we will dive much deeper into those concepts next week.

The homework this week will be a bit different. You will submit some code but you will also take screenshots of some of your debugging work. The Homework section has more details!
