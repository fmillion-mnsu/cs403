# CS 403 - Topics in Programming Languages - Week 7

We made it! By now you should have everything you need to write basic applications in C#. We have, of course, only scratched the surface - there are many other places you can go with C#. C# can be used to write graphical user interface-based applications, mobile applications, Web applications (both the frontend and backend), machine learning tools, and even software for embedded computing systems. From its beginnings, C# has matured into a first-class modern language that encompasses a very wide array of capabilities and applications. 

This week we're going to wrap up by covering a few extra topics related to software development that don't fit nicely into any other of the more major topic areas we have covered in this course. **There will be no homework for this week** - take the time to prepare for and work on your final programming assignment!

## Important Tasks For the Week

* Review the resource guide - for this week, it's simply named "Resource Guide". This is the same material we've been previously calling the Presentation Guide. However, it's a good idea for everyone to review the entire resource guide!
* If you have been assigned a presentation topic, prepare your presentation for class on Friday - see [the Presentation Guide](https://mnsu.learn.minnstate.edu/d2l/le/content/6192136/viewContent/59970825/View) for guidance.
* Prepare for your final project - if you have not submitted a project proposal, make sure you do so **no later than Wednesday April 26th**. *If you haven't submitted a project proposal by Thursday the 27th, I will assign one to you!*
* Take the final exam and finish your final programming project prior to the final due date of **Thursday, May 4th**.
