# CS 403 - Topics in Programming Languages - Week 5

By now, you've gotten your hands dirty with writing some C# code, and you've hopefully learned a bit about programming theory along the way! If you're writing your own code for yourself, you *could* keep right on doing what you've been doing and hope it'll be just fine. But what if you want to share your code with someone else? Or what if you put away your code for a few months and then come back to it?

Documenting your code is an important part of programming. Along with simple comments, C# offers some great ways to allow your code to be self-documenting, which can help both yourself as well as others down the road. Additionally, IDE features like IntelliSense can take advantage of the documentation you write to provide contextual information to help you understand your classes, methods, and so on, even years after you wrote them. (Of course, you might need to update your code if you're pulling it up years after you wrote it, since the .NET framework will likely have changed to some degree in the meantime!)

The homework for this week will build upon your Week 4 homework. Now, you'll split your code into two parts - a "user interface" section and a "logic" section. You'll move some of your code to a *class library* and provide documentation for the methods and classes in that class library. Then, you'll refactor your user interface portion - for us, it's the command line interface - to utilize the class library. Finally, you'll write another piece of code that will use your class library to automate transaction processing - this will represent an alternative user interface to your code.

## Important Tasks For the Week

* Review the resource guide - for this week, it's simply named "Resource Guide". This is the same material we've been previously calling the Presentation Guide. However, it's a good idea for everyone to review the entire resource guide!
* If you have been assigned a presentation topic, prepare your presentation for class on Friday - see [the Presentation Guide](https://mnsu.learn.minnstate.edu/d2l/le/content/6192136/viewContent/59970825/View) for guidance.
* Work on the Week 5 homework and submit by **Tuesday, April 18th, 11:59 PM** in D2L.
