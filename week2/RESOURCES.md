# Week 2 Resources

## This Week's Material

### Debugging (in general)

* [How to debug for absolute beginners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-absolute-beginners?view=vs-2022&tabs=csharp) from Microsoft.

### The C# Debugger

* [Learn to debug code in C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-debugger?view=vs-2022) from Microsoft.
* [Trace and Debug](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/developer/visualstudio/csharp/language-compilers/trace-and-debug) from Microsoft. Discusses the `Debug.WriteLine` method and other methods available on the `Debug` object.
* [Navigating code in the Visual Studio debugger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/navigating-through-code-with-the-debugger?view=vs-2022&tabs=csharp) from Microsoft.

### Breakpoints and Watches

* [Using breakpoints in the Visual Studio debugger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/using-breakpoints?view=vs-2022) at Microsoft.
* [Set a watch on variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/watch-and-quickwatch-windows?view=vs-2022) at Microsoft.

#### Extra resources for comparison with other languages

* [Python's implementation of breakpoints](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/python-breakpoint)
* [An external tool](https://opensource.com/article/21/4/monitor-debug-python) for implementing a function similar to variable watches in Python.
* [Breakpoints in Java](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-breakpoints.html) - a feature of the IntelliJ IDE. (Note that debugger features like watches, breakpoints, etc. are typically not part of the core language, but are provided by your development environment or IDE.)

### Build configurations and conditional compilation

* [C# Preprocessor Directives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives) at Microsoft.
* [Understanding build configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/understanding-build-configurations?view=vs-2022) at Microsoft.
* [Build Configurations](https://csharp.2000things.com/tag/build-configurations/) at "2000 Things You Should Know about C#".

## Useful resources for C# in general

* [C# Language Specification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/introduction).
* [Learn C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/csharp) at Microsoft - Hub for many resources including videos, examples and references for C#.
* [C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) at Microsoft - another hub for C# documentation.
* [C# Corner](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/) - a blog and learning site with a *lot* of C# content. 
* [2000 Things You Should Know About C#](https://csharp.2000things.com/) - bite-sized pieces of knowledge about everything C#.
