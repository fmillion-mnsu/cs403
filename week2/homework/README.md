## Homework

For this week's homework, you will be debugging a program that calculates grade point averages. The program reads input from the console and tries to compute a student's GPA based on a series of grades and credits per course. However, there are some problems with the code. 

The goal of the homework is to fix the bugs in the code that can be fixed by the programmer, and to add appropriate exception handling and checking to handle situations the programmer cannot directly address (such as invalid input from the user).

### Week 2 Assignment

1. Download this week's repository by using the GitHub "Download ZIP" option, and extract the ZIP file to somewhere on your computer:

    ![Screenshot showing the Download ZIP link under "Code" on the GitHub page](../images/github_download.png)

    > If you have experience with Git, you can also just clone the repository to your computer. However, you will not be submitting your homework via Git, so do not try pushing any code to the GitHub repository (it won't work anyway :D).

2. Open the Week2_Homework folder under the `homework` folder.
3. Open the file `Week2_Homework.sln`. This should open Visual Studio and open the project.
4. In the Solution Explorer, **click on the solution** (`Week2_Homework`) and **rename it to:** `week2_Firstname_Lastname`. For example, `week2_Flint_Million`. Click the solution in the Solution Explorer and press F2 to rename it.
5. Open the `Program.cs` file from the Solution Explorer and write the code as requested in the program file.
6. Once you have written, run and tested your code, make a **ZIP file** of the entire `Week2_Homework` folder. The ZIP file MUST either contain the files from inside the `Week2_Homework` folder or the `Week2_Homework` folder itself.
7. Submit the ZIP file on D2L. [This link](https://mnsu.learn.minnstate.edu/d2l/lms/dropbox/user/folder_submit_files.d2l?db=13720348&grpid=0&isprv=0&bp=0&ou=6192136) should take you to the assignment page.

#### Assignment Goals

* Be able to understand and write simple exception handlers
* Be able to use the Visual Studio debugger to debug code that performs incorrectly or crashes
* Be able to use build configurations to have output that is only printed if the program is run in Debug mode.
