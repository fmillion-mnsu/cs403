# CS 403 - Topics in Programming Languages - Week 3

Welcome to Week 3! This week we will be covering core concepts of object-oriented programming and how they are implemented in C#. We will also compare and contrast C# with other languages, such as Java and Python. Through this week's exercises we will learn about strongly-typed languages vs. weakly-typed languages and how each type of language implements object-oriented programming.

You may already be familiar with object-oriented programming and concepts such as classes, so we will quickly review these topics before diving into C#, advanced polymorphism and unique ways that C# represents many constructs as objects.

This week I have combined the resources and the presentation guides. This week's content - especially Friday's - is quite in-depth, and rather than simply repeating the links to the resources, it is a good idea for everyone to review all of the presentation guides and the resources contained within. If you are assigned to present, make sure you pay particular attention to your topic section, but it might be helpful to review all of the content - and you'll also be able to make references to other concepts in your presentation!
